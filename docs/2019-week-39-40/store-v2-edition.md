# Store v2 Edition

Having the new VTEX IO Store v2 Edition installed, stores are now able to run version `2.x.x.` of the app [`store`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store).

:information_source: Edition is a feature whose aim is to fit a userâ€™s specific requirements with VTEX IO apps usage, through various VTEX IO editions such as VTEX IO Enterprise.

## What has changed

Previously, any store that wanted to run on `store` v2 (whether a new one or an already live store still running on v1) needed to manually install each component compatible with the latest version.

With this new feature, all necessary components compatible with `store` v2 are compiled in an Edition. This means that when you install the Store v2 Edition in your store, it will be ready to run all on `store` v2 using all its components with compatibility error-free. 

## Main advantages

Store v2 Edition **simplifies the entire going live process** for new stores, as well as the **transaction process** for stores from `store`v1 to v2, solving compatibility issues quickly and easily. 

## What you need to do 

:warning: **Store v2 Edition can only be installed by someone at VTEX**, by running the command `vtex edition set vtex.edition-store-v2@0.x`. 

Therefore, you can reach out to our support team to understand if this new feature fits to your store's scenario and request its installation.
