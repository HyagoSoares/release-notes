# Product Specifications

The Product Specifications just got a **new prop**, `Collapsible`, that allows retailers to choose if and when the component's content will be collapsible. 

## What has changed

Prior to this improvement, retailers could not control when the component's content was displayed fully expanded or collapsible. 

With this new prop, **retailers can now specifically manage when a block's content is collapsible**: always, never, only on mobile or only on desktop.

## Main advantages

The `Collapsible` prop makes Product Specification more adaptable and in tune with the retailer's wishes, who has now gained more power over the component's behavior.

## What you need to do 

Make sure you store is running  version **3.80.0** or higher of the [**Store Components**](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.store-components) app.
