description: "If you take a deep breath, you can catch a whiff the A/B tests in the air. Thatâ€™s because the Publish command has now changed its functionality and more steps have been added to the process of publishing an app on the platform. Everything to say goodbye to potential instabilities and to foster a culture of tests among our beloved devs."

# Publish command

The `vtex publish` command, responsible for publishing new app versions, has changed its platform behavior.

## What has changed

Previously, the `vtex publish` command automatically published the new version of an app, whether it was in beta or not.

Now, `vtex publish` is just one of the **three steps** needed to effectively publish an app in the VTEX IO's infrastructure.

1. When running the `vtex publish` command in your terminal, a **candidate release version** is now generated. The candidate release is nothing more than a **test phase**, that is, the new version in probation mode. Because of this state, Housekeeper won't automatically install it on any account. To install it, you must order Toolbelt to [install](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-an-app) the exact version.
2. After the installation, it is recommended to manually **perform** [**A/B tests**](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/running-native-ab-testing) on the new version, checking and confirming its stability.
3. Once the necessary testing is completed, the third and last step is to **validate the candidate release** as a version that's ready to become stable on the infrastructure (having the `validated` status). This is achieved using the vtex validate command.

## Why is this action being taken

According to the command's former behavior, you could release a new stable version and publish it as fast as possible and enable it on the platform, without any of the Toolbelt requisites.

Now, the new publication process steps strengthen the culture of these tests in addition to their validation during the development process, bringing **test discipline** and **greater stability** to the platform's apps.

## Side effects

There are not deleterious app development side effects. The consequence of this release is merely the **extra steps** added to the publish process.
